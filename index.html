                WHAT IS C PROGRAMMING? 
            </h3>
            <p style="margin-left:10%" align="justify">
                C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple and flexible. 
                It is machine-independent, structured programming language which is used extensively in various applications.
                C was the basics language to write everything from operating systems (Windows and many others) to complex 
                programs like the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter and more. It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s 
                programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the 
                knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’. It is essential to have a background 
                in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.

                HISTORY OF C LANGUAGE
            </h3>

            <p style="margin-left:10%">
                The base or father of programming languages is ‘ALGOL.’ It was first introduced in 1960. 
                ‘ALGOL’ was used on a large basis in European countries. ‘ALGOL’ introduced the concept of structured programming 
                to the developer community. In 1967, a new computer programming language was announced called as ‘BCPL’ which stands 
                for “Basic Combined Programming Language.” BCPL was designed and developed by Martin Richards, especially for writing 
                system software. This was the era of programming languages. Just after three years, in 1970 a new programming 
                language called ‘B’ was introduced by Ken Thompson that contained multiple features of ‘BCPL.’ This programming 
                language was created using UNIX operating system at AT&T and Bell Laboratories. Both the ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ were system 
                programming languages.

            <p style="margin-left:10%";>
                In 1972, a great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie created a new programming language called ‘C’ at 
                the Bell Laboratories. It was created from ‘ALGOL’, ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ programming languages. ‘C’ programming 
                language contains all the features of these languages and many more additional concepts that make it 
                unique from other languages.
                <br/>
                ‘C’ is a powerful programming language which is strongly associated with the UNIX operating system. Even most of 
                the UNIX operating system is coded in ‘C’. Initially ‘C’ programming was limited to the UNIX operating system, 7
                but as it started spreading around the world, it became commercial, and many compilers were released for 
                cross-platform systems. Today ‘C’ runs under a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms. As it started 
                evolving many different versions of the language were released. At times it became difficult for the developers 
                to keep up with the latest version as the systems were running under the older versions. To assure that ‘C’ language 
                will remain standard, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defined a commercial standard for ‘C’ language 
                in 1989. Later, it was approved by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in 1990. ‘C’ programming language 
                is also called as ‘ANSI C’.
                <br/>
                Languages such as C++/Java are developed from ‘C’. These languages are widely used in various technologies. 
                Thus, ‘C’ forms a base for many other languages that are currently in use.

                ‘C’ language is widely used in embedded systems.

                WHY LEARN ‘C’?
            </h2>

            <p style="margin-left:10%";>
                As we studied earlier, ‘C’ is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning ‘C’ as the main language 
                will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares the same concepts such as data 
                types, operators, control statements and many more. ‘C’ can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple 
                language and provides faster execution. There are many jobs available for a ‘C’ developer in the current market.
                ‘C’ is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be 
                written separately and together it forms a single ‘C’ program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining 
                and debugging processes.
                <br/>
                ‘C’ contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very 
                efficient.
                <br/>
                Another feature of ‘C’ programming is that it can extend itself. A ‘C’ program contains various functions which 
                are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions 
                anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.
                <br/>
                Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language.
                <br/>
                It is a highly portable language which means programs written in ‘C’ language can run on other machines. This 
                feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.

                HOW ‘C’ WORKS?
            </h2>

            <p style="margin-left:10%";>
                C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the 
                object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different 
                object files and creates a single executable file to run the program. The following diagram shows the 
                execution of a ‘C’ program

            </center>

            <p style="margin-left:10%">
                Nowadays, various compilers are available online, and you can use any of those compilers. 
                The functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will provide the features required to 
                execute both ‘C’ and ‘C++’ programs.
            </p>
