				Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and colleagues at Sun Microsystems in 
				the early 1990s. Unlike conventional languages which are generally designed either to be compiled to native (machine) 
				code, or to be interpreted from source code at runtime, Java is intended to be compiled to a bytecode, which is then 
				run (generally using JIT compilation) by a Java Virtual Machine.
				<br/>
				The language itself borrows much syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. 
				Java is only distantly relate to JavaScript, though they have similar names and share a C-like syntax.

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">History</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				James Gosling started Java as a project called “Oak” in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine 
				and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. The first 
				public implementation was Java 1.0 in 1995. It made the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere", with free runtimes on 
				popular platforms. It was secure and its security was configurable, allowing for network and file access to be limited. 
				The major web browsers soon incorporated it into their standard configurations in a secure "applet" configuration. 
				Popular quickly. New versions for large and small platforms (J2EE and J2ME) soon were design with the advent of "Java 2". Sun has not announced any plans for a "Java 3".<br/>
				In 1997, Sun approached the ISO/IEC JTC1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew 
				from the process. Java remains a proprietary de facto standard that is controlled through the Java Community Process. Sun makes 
				most of its Java implementations available without charge, with revenue being generated by specialized products such as the 
				Java Enterprise System. Sun distinguishes between its Software Development Kit (SDK) and Runtime Environment (JRE), which is a 
				subset of the SDK, the primary distinction being that in the JRE the compiler, is not present.

				Philosophy
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:-
				<ol style="margin-left:10%;">
					<li>It should use the object-oriented programming methodology.</li>
					<li>It should allow the same program to be executed on multiple operating systems.</li>
					<li>It should contain built-in support for using computer networks</li>
					<li>It should be design to execute code from remote sources securely.</li>
					<li>It should be easy to use by selecting what was considered the good parts of other object-oriented languages</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				To achieve the goals of networking support and remote code execution, Java programmers sometimes find it necessary to 
				use extensions such as CORBA, Internet Communications Engine.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%">
				Object orientation
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				The first characteristic, object orientation ("OO"), refers to a method of programming and language design. 
				Although there are many interpretations of OO, one primary distinguishing idea is to design software so that the 
				various types of data it manipulates are combine together with their relevant operations. Thus, data and code are 
				combine into entities called objects. An object can thought of as a self-contained bundle of behavior (code) and 
				state (data). The principle is to separate the things that change from the things that stay the same; often, a 
				change to some data structure requires a corresponding change to the code that operates on that data, or vice 
				versa. This separation into coherent objects provides a more stable foundation for a software system's design. 
				The intent is to make large software projects easier to manage, thus improving quality and reducing the number of 
				failed projects.
				<br/>
				Another primary goal of OO programming is to develop objects that are more generic so that software can become 
				more reusable between projects. A generic "customer" object, for example, should have roughly the same basic set 
				of behaviors between different software projects, especially when these projects overlap on some fundamental level 
				as they often do in large organizations. In this sense, software objects can be seen more as pluggable components, 
				helping the software industry build projects largely from existing and well-tested pieces, thus leading to a 
				massive reduction in development times. Software reusability has met with mixed practical results, with two main 
				difficulties: the design of truly generic objects is poorly understood, and a methodology for broad communication 
				of reuse opportunities is lacking. Some open source communities want to help ease the reuse problem, by providing 
				authors with ways to disseminate information about generally reusable objects and object libraries.
			</p>
			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Syntax
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				The syntax of Java is largely derive from C++. However, unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, 
				generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built from the ground up to be virtually fully object-oriented: 
				everything in Java is an object with the exceptions of atomic datatypes (ordinal and real numbers, Boolean values, 
				and characters) and everything in Java is written inside a class.
