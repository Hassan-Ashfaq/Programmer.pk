				PYTHON LANGUAGE
			</h2>
			<br/>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				In contemporary times, 126,424 websites are made using the python programming language. Many top-notch companies 
				have developed successful apps by using it. This is why it is considered the language of today and the future.
				<br/>
				Python might not had bright years in the past since its launch in 1991 but it has seen a constant and remarkable 
				trend of growth in the 21st century. This stack overflow graph of major programming languages' growth clearly 
				depicts the steady upliftment of the PYTHON!

				The growth rate of python was not something easy to achieve. There are various attributes of this programming tool 
				which has provided it with an amazing successful journey. Python has a major role in the latest technologies of 
				current and future times like ML and AI. 
				<br/>
				Looking at the bright scope of these technologies which are heavily supported by python codes, many people wonder, 
				“Is python the future of programming?”
				<br/>
				Before giving a shot to answer this question, I would like to share some of the facts of this programming tool. 
				These facts are the advantageous features of python which make it an incredible programming language in 2019.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Benefits of python #1: It’s free!
			</h3>

			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				Python is an open-source programming language, which makes it available to the masses. It is completely free to 
				use this language. Its codes can be utilized by anyone over the internet. This makes it ideal for companies
				with budget constraints. 
				The overall development cost decreases if the tools your python developers are using are available for free! 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Benefits of python #2: Capable of both backend and frontend development 
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				It is not a specific purpose language. In fact, python is a general-purpose language and these programming 
				languages can be used for both front-end and back-end development. Other examples of such tools are Java, C++, etc. 
				<br/>
				Python language is not as supportive for front end as it is for back-end. But still, some of its frameworks can be 
				used for frontend development. Its two frameworks, namely; Django and Flask are extensively used as backend programming 
				framework by many startups. 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Benefits of python #3: Cross-platform language
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				Python is an amazing language that supports different operating systems. Ubuntu, Linus, Windows, etc are all 
				well-supported by this programming tool. This means that if your python developers will write codes on Mac, it 
				will run seamlessly on windows. 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Benefits of python #4: Strong support of the community
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				For every programmer, writing bug-free code is a challenge. In every project, there comes a point where the 
				developers gets stuck and need support. No one likes to get started with a language where their queries will 
				get hard to resolve. 
				This problem is never faced by the Python web developers. According to the latest data of Stack Overflow, 
				Python is among the top five most loved programming languages for professional developers of 2019.

			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				Hence, this programming tool has strong community support with a plethora of tutorials. The major reason behind 
				this is long active years of python. There is no limit to avail help from the python community.
				<br/>
				This is the reason small businesses can rely on python for their next software development project as the work 
				will be done by the hired software developers flawlessly and in a smooth way. 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				Benefits of python #5: Provides a plethora of tools
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
				Python programming language package has a huge standard library collection. They reduce the need for effort for 
				writing codes or functions. This is because the libraries come with pre-written codes.
				Some of the tolls are Tkinter (a GUI development tool), file formats, built-in functions, custom python 
				interpreters, internet protocol and support, modules, etc. This large collection enhances the overall usability and 
				functioning of python as a programming tool. 
				<br/>
				This reduces the time taken to develop software by your python mobile app development company. Hence, usage of 
				python programming language for your project helps in saving your resources exponentially. 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%">Benefits of python #6: Fewer codes</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:10%", align="justify">
				Python is one of those programming languages which is easy to use and write. In comparison to other general purpose 
				languages, it is extremely convenient to use python. Although, if one has to become an expert in python programming, 
				then they will have to master a lot of technicalities. 
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-left:10%;">
				So, after reading about these benefits of python, are you excited to use it for your next software application? 
				If you are in doubt, then look at these top-notch brands that are using python from a long time and successfully.
