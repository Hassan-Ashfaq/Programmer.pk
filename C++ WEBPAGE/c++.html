                The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language 
                – a Middle-Level Language. The C++ programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist 
                (Bjarne Stroustrup) at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic 
                language, which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionally of active type checking, basic inheritance, 
                default functioning argument, classes, in lining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.
                C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand for adding 
                one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.”

                There are several benefits of using C++ for developing applications and many applications product 
                based developed in this language only because of its features and security. Please find the below sections, 
                where uses of C++ has been widely and effectively used. Below is the list of top 10 uses of C++.
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left:10%;", align="justify">
                <li>
                    Applications: It is used for development of new applications of C++. The applications based on graphic 
                    user interface, which are highly used applications like adobe photoshop and others. Many applications of 
                    Adobe systems are developed in C++ like Illustrator, adobe premiere and image ready and Adobe developers 
                    are considered as active in the C++ community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Games: This language is also used for developing games. It overrides the complexity of 3D games. It helps in 
                    optimizing the resources. It supports multiplayer option with networking. uses of C++ allows procedural 
                    programming for intensive functions of CPU and to provide control over hardware, and this language is very 
                    fast because of which it is widely used in developing different games or in gaming engines. C++ mainly used 
                    in developing the suites of a game tool.
                </li>
                <li>Animation: There are animated software’s, which are developed with help of C++ language. 3D animation, 
                    modeling, simulation, rendering software are referred to as the powerful toolset. It is widely used in 
                    building real-time, image processing, mobile sensor applications, and visual effects, modeling which is 
                    mainly coded in C++. This developed software used for animation, environments, motion graphics, virtual 
                    reality, and character creation. Virtual real devices are the most popular in today’s entertainment world.
                </li>
                <li>Web Browser: This language is used for developing browser’s as well. C++ is used for making Google Chrome, 
                    and Mozilla Internet browser Firefox. Some of the applications are written in C++, from which Chrome browser 
                    is one of them and others are like a file system, the map reduces large cluster data processing. Mozilla has 
                    other application also written in C++ that is email client Mozilla Thunderbird. C++ is also a rendering 
                    engine for the open source projects of Google and Mozilla.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Database Access: This language is also used for developing database software or open source database software. 
                    The example for this is MySQL, which is one of the most popular database management software and widely used 
                    in organizations or among the developers. It helps in saving time, money, business systems, and packaged 
                    software. There are other database software access based applications used that are Wikipedia, Yahoo, 
                    youtube etc. The other example is Bloomberg RDBMS, which helps in providing real-time financial 
                    information to investors. It is mainly written in C++, which makes database access fast and quick or 
                    accurate to deliver information regarding business and finance, news around the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operating Systems: It is also used for developing most of the operating systems for Microsoft and few parts 
                    of Apple operating system. Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, office, Internet Explorer and visual studio, 
                    Symbian mobile operating systems are mainly written in C++ language only.
                </li>
                <li>Compilers: Most of the compilers mainly written in C++ language only. The compilers that are used for 
                    compiling other languages like C#, Java etc. mainly written in C++ only. It is also used in developing 
                    these languages as well as C++ is platform independent and able to create a variety of software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Media Access: C++ is also used for creating a media player, managing video files and audio files. The example 
                    is Winamp Media player, which is developed in C++ language, which allows us to enjoy music, access and share 
                    the videos and music files. It also has features like art support, streaming of audio and video. It also 
                    provides access to Internet radio stations.

                <li>
                    Other Uses: it is used for medical and engineering applications, Computer-aided design systems. These 
                    applications are like MRI scans machines, CAM systems that are mainly used in hospitals, local, state 
                    and national government, and other departments for construction and mining etc. applications of C++ is 
                    considered as a first preferred language to use among the developer when performance is considered for 
                    any developing application.
